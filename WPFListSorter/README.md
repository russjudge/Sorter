# WPF List Sorter

This is a simple library to add to your WPF applications for adding sort functionality to the columns of ListViews and any other controls that inherit from ItemsControl.

For an example of how to use this, see the example project at https://github.com/russjudge/Sorter.

To use this, all you need to do after adding a reference in your XAML, is to set the SortColumnID to the property name that of the row that you want to sort on, setting this as
an attribute in your header.
